# Language-Learning-Tools
A few tools to learn some languages that I want to learn/get better at. Mostly aimed at pronunciation and translation to practice speaking when there aren't many opportunities so I know what I'm saying and if I'm getting the pronunciation right.

Uses libraries that mean you can edit the speech-to-text software from Google to something like CMU Sphinx, and pick the best translation tool. From personal testing, Google accepts the most input languages and Sogou is best for Mandarin to English.

Tier List for Mandarin-English translation from my experience (could be different for other languages)

S - SOGOU

A - DEEPL, ALIBABA, TENCENT, GOOGLE

B - YOUDAO, BING

C - BAIDU
